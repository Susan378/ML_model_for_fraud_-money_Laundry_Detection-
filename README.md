One of the most common threats that financial institutions face is money laundering. This is a process that involves converting black money into white currency. Despite the various steps that financial institutions can take to prevent money laundering, it is still not easy to prevent it from happening due to the technological advancements that have occurred. 
Due to the increasing threat of money laundering and terrorism financing, financial institutions are actively equipping themselves with the necessary tools and technologies.
Detecting money laundering activities in financial institutions is another important job for machine learning, which also prevents consumers from accessing their accounts until the problem is fixed. Several algorithms are used by machine learning to spot money laundering activities and significantly reduce it. We will discover how a machine learning model can assist in identifying suspicious account activity.
I suggest to develop a machine learning model that can classify a Fraud or Non Fraud activity
The solution can: monitor Transaction Behaviour

To train the ML model, I used a synthetic dataset called PaySim. It is based on an analysis of a representative sample of actual transactions taken from a month's worth of financial records from a mobile money service used in an African nation.
On Kaggle, the data is accessible to everyone.
There are 6362620 Transaction records in this dataset, each with 11 characteristics.
Any system that seeks to lessen false positives (alarms) triggered by anti-money laundering alert systems can use this method.
